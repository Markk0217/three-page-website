      <p><mark class="LH"> It's a summer of unrest in Hong Kong, with thousands of protesters taking to the streets every week. </mark></p>
      <p>It all started in June when millions came out to oppose a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to China. Carrie Lam, the city's leader, has shelved the bill, but the protests have morphed into something bigger. </p>
      <p>Some are now calling for Lam to step down, greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged policy brutality. </p>
      <p>As the demonstrations have dragged on, protesters have embraced more extreme, sometimes violent, tactics. And police have done the same. </p>
      <p>While Hong Kong remains safe on the whole, those inside the city still worry about where this all leads and if there is an end in sight. </p>
