        <p>As violence erupted on a 12-consecutive weekend in Hong Kong, a picture showing a large group of journalists cornering a solitary police officer while indifferent to the nearby chaos went viral online, helping the public see the truth hidden behind biased cameras.</p>

        <p>Initially published by People's Daily on its Sina Weibo on Aug. 24, the picture was taken right after thousands of protestors gathered in Kowloon, vandalizing smart lampposts, as well as attacking local police officers using iron bars and bricks.</p>

        <p>In the picture, a police officer was taking notice of the ongoing violent attacks at a street corner, holding his gun; while dozens of journalists, without paying the slightest attention to the nearby vandalism and mobs, surrounded the police officer and casted their flashlight only on him.</p>

        <p>Some Hong Kong media outlets later depicted the police officer as "the riot police officer who aims at protestors." Ironically, as if coordinated, they all brushed aside or downplayed the mobs' violent attacks.</p>
